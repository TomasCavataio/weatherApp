# WeatherApp

This is my Weather app fully made on Angular, since its a PWA you can install it on your favorite phone or favorite device and make it work offline once it has cached some resources.

You can try the app by clicking here: [https://tomascavataio.github.io/weatherApp/](https://tomascavataio.github.io/weatherApp/)

Allow the geolocation request to see your location weather info or search for any place that is of your interest!

Here you can see a short demo:
